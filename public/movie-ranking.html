<h1>The Best Movies According to Menwil</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Devil Wears Prada</h3>

<p>
I enjoy this movie because of Meryl Streep's witty comments.<br />
The humour is very funny and the fashion is fabulous!
</p>

<h3>Chukkie</h3>

<p>
I enjoy horror movies and Chukkie is one of my favourites of all time.<br />
Although the scenes are not realistic, I love sitting on the edge of my seat :)
</p>

<h3>Beethoven</h3>

<p>
I love dogs, so this movie is all about a dog takes over a house.<br />
The dad was not happy with this dog at the beginning of the movie, but later on the dog (Beethoven) won his heart.
